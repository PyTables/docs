# docs/ folder for pytables.org

The pytables documentation (www.pytables.org) is hosted via GitHub pages
from the PyTables/pytables.github.com repo.
The PyTables docs are build from the main repo and push to PyTables/pytables.github.com
by travis-CI at every release/tag.  

This repo is also published using Github pages and contains static files (pdfs and such)
that are not built from the main repo, but are linked to.

(do not remove this repo!)
